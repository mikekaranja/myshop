        In using the varied features of the Services, Customer may provide

      <li><strong>Term and Termination</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Customer may terminate this Agreement at any time. See also Section 6
        below (Fees and Payment; Upgrade, Downgrade and Cancellation of
        Services) for more information regarding termination of this Agreement
        or related Services.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Emerse may terminate this Agreement or the Services at any time with or
        without cause, and with or without notice. Emerse will have no liability
        to Customer or any third party because of such termination.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement by either party for any
        reason, (a) Emerse will cease providing the Services, (b) you will not
        be entitled to any refunds of any usage fees or any other fees, pro rata
        or otherwise and (c) any outstanding balance owed to Emerse for your
        usage of the Services through the effective date of such termination or
        expiration will immediately become due and payable in full. All sections
        of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will
        survive termination, including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers
        and limitations of liability.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement by either party for any
        reason, Emerse may delete any Customer archived data within 30 days
        after the date of termination.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="4">
      <li><strong>Disputes Regarding Account or Site Ownership</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The entity or person creating a Emerse account and designated as the
        owner will be deemed the account owner. For security reasons, only the
        account owner or the point of contact designated by the account owner
        will be allowed to make changes, cancellations, or designate a new point
        of contact. Disputes sometimes arise between or among multiple persons
        claiming ownership of or rights in a site, store or account. Emerse is
        not obligated to, and will not, resolve any such disputes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If multiple persons are claiming ownership of or rights in a site, store
        or account, and, in Emerse's sole judgment, there is uncertainty as to
        the ownership of or rights in such site, store or account, then Emerse
        will, to the extent of its knowledge and ability, notify such persons of
        the dispute and demand that such persons promptly, conclusively, and
        finally resolve the dispute in a manner which makes clear who the
        owner(s) and/or interest holder(s) is/are and in a manner which relieves
        Emerse of all liability and obligations concerning the dispute and such
        site, store or account. If the disputing persons fail to resolve the
        dispute within what Emerse, in its sole judgment, deems to be a
        reasonable time, then Emerse, at its sole option and without any
        obligation to do so, may suspend or terminate the account until such
        persons resolve such dispute and reach certainty regarding ownership of
        or rights in such website, store and/or account. The person or persons
        conclusively and finally determined by court order, binding arbitration
        or settlement agreement to be the rightful owner(s) or interest
        holder(s) of such website, store and/or account will be obligated to pay
        all amounts due to transfer ownership of the site, store and/or account
        to the rightful owner. Failure of the rightful owner of such site, store
        and/or account to timely pay in full all of such amounts will be deemed
        a breach of these Terms and will subject the account to immediate
        termination.

        Name and Trademarks. Customer hereby grants Emerse a non-exclusive right
        and license to use Customer&rsquo;s name and such of Customer&rsquo;s
        trade names, trademarks, service marks and logos ("Customer&rsquo;s
        Marks") as are used by Customer on Customer&rsquo;s hosted sites in
        connection with this Agreement, and images and publically-facing
        information about Customer on Customer&rsquo;s hosted sites including,
        but not limited to, screenshots of Customer&rsquo;s hosted sites and
        associated photographs appearing on Customer&rsquo;s hosted sites
        ("Customer Public Information and Images"): (a) on Emerse's own websites
        describing and promoting Emerse's Services, (b) in printed and online
        advertising, publicity, directories, newsletters and updates describing
        and promoting Emerse's Services, and (c) in applications reasonably
        necessary and ancillary to the foregoing. Customer (i) represents and
        warrants to Emerse that Customer has all necessary rights to grant
        Emerse the foregoing rights, and (ii) agrees that neither Customer nor
        anyone else will be entitled to any compensation for Emerse's exercise
        of the foregoing rights.

      <li>
        Customer Voluntary Suggestions. Some of the features of this website or
        the Services found at this website may allow Customer to view, post,
        publish, share, store, or manage (a) ideas, opinions, recommendations,
        feedback or advice (" Customer Feedback"), or (b) literary, artistic or
        other content, including but not limited to photos and videos ("
        Customer Submissions") (Customer Feedback together with Customer
        Submissions, "Customer Voluntary Suggestions"). By providing Customer
        Voluntary Suggestions to Emerse via any method (e.g. site submission,
        email, survey responses, etc.), Customer represents and warrants to
        Emerse that (i) Customer has all necessary rights to distribute Customer
        Voluntary Suggestions via this website or via the Services found at this
        website, either because Customer is the author of the Customer Voluntary
        Suggestions and has the right to distribute the same, or because
        Customer has the appropriate distribution rights, licenses and/or
        permissions to use, in writing, from the copyright or other owner of the
        Customer Voluntary Suggestions, and (ii) Customer does not violate the
        rights of any third party by providing the Customer Voluntary
        Suggestions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        License to Emerse. Emerse will have the right to use and disclose any
        Customer Voluntary Suggestions posted to Emerse's corporate websites or
        submitted directly to Emerse for any lawful purpose. In no event will
        Customer or anyone else be entitled to any compensation or
        acknowledgement for Emerse's use of any Customer Voluntary Suggestions.
        Customer's provision of Customer Voluntary Suggestions is entirely
        voluntary and will not create any confidentiality obligation for Emerse.
        By submitting Customer Voluntary Suggestions, Customer hereby grants
        Emerse an irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, non-exclusive,
        fully-paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide license (sublicensable through
        multiple tiers) to: (a) use, copy, distribute, reproduce, modify, create
        derivative works of, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, and
        publicly display Customer Voluntary Suggestions (or any modification
        thereto), in whole or in part, in any format, medium or application now
        known or later developed, and (b) use (and permit others to use)
        Customer Voluntary Suggestions in any manner and for any purpose
        (including, but not limited to, commercial purposes) that Emerse deems
        appropriate in its sole discretion (including, but not limited to, to
        incorporating Customer Voluntary Suggestions (or any modification
        thereto), in whole or in part, into any technology, product or service.
        The provisions in this Section apply specifically to Emerse's use of
        Customer Voluntary Suggestions posted to Emerse's corporate websites or
        submitted directly to Emerse, and not to Customer&rsquo;s hosted sites.
        Customer will be solely responsible for any and all of the Customer
        Voluntary Suggestions that are submitted through Customer&rsquo;s
        account, and the consequences of, and requirements for, distributing it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Discussion Areas. Emerse makes no representations or warranties with
        respect to any forums, blogs, private messages, emails, or other
        electronic discussion mediums made available on or via the Services
        (collectively, " Discussion Areas") or with respect to any messages,
        information, or materials contained in the Discussion Areas. Customer's
        use of, or reliance upon, any such messages, information, or materials
        is at Customer's sole risk and expense. Emerse does not, and cannot,
        review all of the information and materials provided in the Discussion
        Areas and has no responsibility or liability for any such information or
        materials or their use. If Emerse becomes aware of any information or
        materials that it determines violate these Terms or the Discussion
        Areas' policies promulgated by Emerse from time to time or that Emerse
        otherwise deems inappropriate in its sole discretion, Emerse reserves
        the right to delete, move, or edit any such information or materials.

      </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In consideration of the Services provided, Customer will pay Emerse all
        fees due according to the prices and terms listed on this website.
        Emerse reserves the right to modify its pricing and terms at any time,
        and such changes or modifications will be posted on this website and
        effective immediately upon the next renewal, billing period, upgrade or
        downgrade of the Services with and/or without notice to Customer. All
        payments are NON-REFUNDABLE.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Billing Policies and Cycles. The billing cycle begins on the day
        Customer converts to a paid store (the "Billing Date") and is due on
        that day each month, partial year or year thereafter, depending on the
        Service plan selected and billing terms for individual Services. Billing
        related to the purchase of SSLs or Domains are billed once these
        products/services have been purchased by Customer.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Emerse will accept payments via Cheque or MPESA. Fees for prepaid
        Services are based on Services purchased, regardless of actual usage and
        payments made for such Services are NON-REFUNDABLE. Emerse DOES NOT
        PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL DAYS, MONTHS OR YEARS AND
        DOES NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS TO CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT USE THEIR ACCOUNTS OR
        LOG IN.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Unpaid Accounts. If payment is not received within 30 calendar days of
        the billing date, Emerse will automatically revoke access to Customer's
        account. Emerse may or may not contact Customer directly to notify
        Customer of its unpaid account. Accounts past due over 90 days will
        automatically be deactivated.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Disputed Charges/Billing Inquiries. It is Customer's obligation to
        review all charges for accuracy. Customer has 30 days from the date of
        billing to contact Emerse and/or dispute the charge. Failure to do so
        within the specified time frame will constitute Customer's agreement
        that all charges are valid and Customer thereby waives any claims it may
        have had regarding such charge.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Should Customer elect to upgrade its prepaid Services or if such
        Services are automatically upgraded pursuant to the last sentence of
        this Section 7.7, the Billing Date of the next renewal period will
        remain the same; however, Customer will be billed immediately for the
        pro-rata portion of the upgraded Services fee for the remainder of the
        current billing period. For example, if a month-to-month customer is
        billed on October 9th for monthly prepaid Services from October 9th to
        November 8th, and such Customer&rsquo;s account is upgraded effective on
        October 30th, then such Customer will be charged immediately for the
        pro-rata usage of the upgraded plan from October 30th to November 8th.
        On November 9th such Customer will be charged for the full monthly fee
        amount of the upgraded plan.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Should Customer elect to downgrade its prepaid Services, the downgrade
        will take effect on the commencement of the next renewal period. In
        other words, Emerse DOES NOT provide credits or refunds on downgrades
        that are effective during the applicable billing period (whether such
        period is a month, quarter or year). For example, if a month-to-month
        customer is billed on October 9th for prepaid Services from October 9th
        to November 8th and such customer downgrades the prepaid Services
        effective on October 30th, then the downgrade will take effect on the
        next billing date, i.e. November 9th.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Emerse Services will continue in effect until Customer validly
        terminates the Services.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Customer must notify Emerse of its intent to terminate prepaid Services
        at least 5 calendar days before the billing renewal date.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="7">
      <li><strong>Prohibited Practices</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Prohibited Offerings. Customer may not utilize the Services for
        unlawful, obscene, offensive or fraudulent content or activity, such as
        advocating or causing harm, interfering with or violating the integrity
        or security of a network or system, evading filters, sending
        unsolicited, abusive or deceptive messages, viruses or harmful code, or
        violating third party rights.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Private Information and Images. Customers may not post or disclose any
        personal or private information about or images of children or any third
        party without the consent of such party (or a parent's consent in the
        case of a minor).

    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Anonymous Proxies. Emerse does not allow the use of anonymous proxy
        scripts on its servers. They can be very abusive to the server
        resources, affecting all users on that server. Customer will not access
        or copy any portion of the Services through any automated viewing,
        downloading or crawling systems.

      <li>
        Child Pornography. The use of the Services to store, post, display,
        transmit, sell, advertise or otherwise make available child pornography
        is prohibited. Emerse is required by law to, and will, notify law
        enforcement agencies when it becomes aware of the presence of child
        pornography on, or being transmitted through, the Services.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Other Illegal Activities. The use of the Services to engage in any
        activity that is determined by Emerse, in its sole and absolute
        discretion, to be illegal is prohibited. Such illegal activities
        include, but are not limited to, storing, posting, displaying,
        transmitting, selling or otherwise making available ponzi or pyramid
        schemes, fraudulently charging credit cards or displaying credit card
        information of third parties without their consent, and failure to
        comply with applicable online privacy laws. Emerse will cooperate fully
        with appropriate law enforcement agencies in connection with any and all
        illegal activities occurring on or through the Services.
      </li>

      <li>
        Other Activities. This list of prohibitions provides examples of
        prohibited conduct and is not intended to be a complete or exclusive
        list of all prohibitions. Engaging in any activity that, in Emerse's
        sole and absolute discretion, disrupts, interferes with or is harmful to
        (or threatens to disrupt, interfere with, or be harmful to) the
        Services, Emerse's business, operations, reputation, goodwill, customers
        and/or customer relations, or the ability of Emerse's customers to
        effectively use the Services is prohibited. Such prohibited activities
        include making available any program, product or service that is
        designed to or could be used to violate these Terms. In addition, the
        failure of Customer to cooperate with Emerse in correcting or preventing
        violations of these Terms by, or that result from the activity of, a
        customer, patron, subscriber, invitee, visitor, or guest of Customer
        constitutes a violation of these Terms by Customer. Without limiting the
        rights and remedies available to it, Emerse reserves the right in its
        sole discretion, to suspend or terminate Customer's access to its
        account and the Services, with or without notice, and to take any other
        action that Emerse determines in its sole discretion is necessary as a
        result of any behavior by Customer that is illegal, inappropriate,
        disruptive to this website, the Services, or to any other user of this
        website or the Services, or which otherwise breaches these Terms. Emerse
        may report to law enforcement authorities any actions that may be
        illegal, and any reports it receives of such conduct. When legally
        required, or otherwise in Emerse's sole discretion, Emerse will
        cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any investigation of alleged
        illegal activity conducted using this website or the Services. These
        prohibitions do not require Emerse to monitor, police, remove or reject
        any content, information, graphics, photographs or links on
        Customer&rsquo;s hosted sites or any Customer Voluntary Suggestions or
        other information submitted by Customer or any other user.

        purposes, Emerse from time to time backs up data on its servers, but is
        under no obligation or duty to Customer to do so under these Terms. IT
        IS SOLELY CUSTOMER'S DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO SEPARATELY BACKUP
        CUSTOMER&rsquo;S FILES AND DATA WHICH MAY RESIDE ON Emerse SERVERS.
